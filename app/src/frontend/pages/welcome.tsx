            Colouring {config.cityName} is a free knowledge exchange platform designed to provide over fifty types
            of open data on buildings in the city, to help make the city more sustainable.

            based at the Alan Turing Institute (the UK's national Institute for data science and artificial intelligence).
            The programme works with local, regional, national and international partners to develop
            open platform code also of relevance to other cities.
        </p>
        <p>
            New datasets and features are added all the time. Any help you can give, colouring-in our building maps,
            and enriching and verifying our open datasets is very much appreciated.
