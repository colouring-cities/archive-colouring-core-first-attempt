# Configuring your Colouring Cities Environment
> Work in progress  

To reduce the work required to create a Colouring Cities environment for your city/region, we have added a configuration file to the CC source code, which can be found here: [app/src/cc-config](../app/src/cc-config.json).

In this file, you cn configure various properties of the CC environment, including:

Project properties:
- City Name - i.e. "Colouring {London}".  
- Project Blurb - a unique, preferably one-sentence introduction to your specific Colouring project.  
- GitHub URL - a link to the GitHub repository for your Colouring project.  

Map Settings:
- Initial Map Position - the location shown on the map when the site first loads, specified as [latitude, longitude].  
- Initial Zoom Level - the level of zoom initially used on the map when the site first loads. The default is 16, higher numbers will increase the zoom level and lower numbers will decrease it.

> More options to be added later
