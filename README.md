# Colouring Cities Core Platform

> Work in progress

The core implementation of the [Colouring Cities](https://github.com/colouring-cities) platform.

Colouring Cities is a web-based citizen social science project designed to help address these questions by crowd-sourcing and visualising various categories of information on a cityâ€™s buildings.

See [colouring-london](https://github.com/colouring-cities/colouring-london/) 
for the reference implementation.

## Structure

This repository will contain open-source code for the project which:

- stores building footprint polygons and source metadata
- allows site users to record building attribute data
- serves map tiles rendered from collected data
- allows site visitors to download the collected building attribute data

Building attribute data collected as part of the project will be made available
for download under a liberal open data license
([ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/)).

## Setup and run

#### Test the application:

You can try out the Colouring Cities application by setting up your own development environment, which includes the option to load test data from OpenStreetMaps (OSM). See [docs/setup-dev-environment](docs/setup-dev-environment.md).

#### Configuring the application:

You can customise the appearance and settings for the Colouring Cities application, for example by changing the Colouring {City Name} or changing the initial map location. This is done through JSON config files. For more, see [docs/configure-your-environment](docs/configure-your-environment.md).

#### Create a production version of the application:

We also have documentation on setting up a production environment here: [docs/setup-production-environment](docs/setup-production-environment.md).
